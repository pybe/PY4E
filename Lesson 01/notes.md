# Lesson 01: Installing Python

## https://www.py4e.com/lessons/install

Installed python 3.11 on mac using brew

Installed Brackets using brew to take a look, vscode already installed. Will be working on vscode-server which I have setup recently so that I can work from any computer with out syncing anything and have a standardised setup.

Trying to add python to code-server and is asking for sudo password for user abc. It seems there are some setup steps I have missed, will do some reading and find out the config options I have over looked.

Couldn't get the sudo password hash to work but found out that the linuxserver.io provide docker mods that allow you add things into the container by an env tag https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-mods
